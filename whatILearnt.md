# Information about my learning process

## The tutorial I followed: https://youtu.be/rHux0gMZ3Eg?si=pBwhvKtiC43VjjhE

### Project setup

**Python and Django**

As the tutorial showed me I did the same, and set up my first django project.

- interpreter
- integrated terminal
- environment
- etc.

### App

I created my first app named as 'playeground'

### View/ api call

I created the first view, basically I send back a basic html or render a template

### Mapping URL

I had to map the url for the previous view

Now also you can try the following request: http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground/hello/

### Templates

I also created a basic template which I can render, also I can use variables in the template (dinamically).

### Debugging

I also learnt about the django debugging method and after that I set up the Django Debug Toolbar

### ORM

I learnt about models, relation between them and implement them.

Now I can use Django admin for CRUD in database

I made a basic library system, where are these api calls/ requests:

- get a book by name.
- get books from specific author
- get books by category name.
- CRUD

**Usage:**

127.0.0.1:8000/books

### CRUD

I implemented the CRUD operations. Also I changed the url method for the form method when I pass the variables from frontend to backend.

### Review and rating system

I implemented these, you can see every at book's detail page

There I learnt about Model 'manipulation' with Meta class

And to add explicit value to a form, using a new variable and the 'commit false' thing

### Django Rest Framework

I looked in the documentation, I red a lot about apis, views, serializers.

I implemented a very basic api with view and a serializer.

You can try with the following link:
