# Information about my learning process

## The tutorial I followed: https://youtu.be/rHux0gMZ3Eg?si=pBwhvKtiC43VjjhE

### Project setup

**Python and Django**

As the tutorial showed me I did the same, and set up my first django project.

- interpreter
- integrated terminal
- environment
- etc.

### App

I created my first app named as 'playeground'

### View/ api call

I created the first view, basically I send back a basic html or render a template

### Mapping URL

I had to map the url for the previous view

Now also you can try the following request: http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground/hello/

### Templates

I also created a basic template which I can render, also I can use variables in the template (dinamically).

### Debugging

I also learnt about the django debugging method and after that I set up the Django Debug Toolbar
